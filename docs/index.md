## Features

- **Complete configurability** - manage everything declaratively through YAML files
- **Seamless interoperability** - access all applications via a single sign-on portal
- **Batteries included** - benefit from a diverse range of applications
- **Containerized solution** - designed to operate in a rootless Docker environment
- **Security by default** - use HTTPS and secure server settings across the system

## Why Lungo?

We believe that self-hosting should be accessible and straightforward for everyone, especially for small-to-mid-scale
home lab setups where scalability and high availability may not be the primary concerns. Our focus is on prioritizing
easy setup and low maintenance.

Lungo is specifically designed to meet these needs. It uses a YAML-based configuration system to simplify the
customization of users, applications, and more. This eliminates the complexities associated with database maintenance
and accelerates backup and restoration processes.

Lungo comes with a single sign-on portal and a diverse range of applications that can be individually enabled or
disabled. You have the flexibility to grant application access on a per-role or per-user basis. Anonymous access is also
supported when enabled.

Lungo not only works, but it also looks and feels great. It utilizes a modern UI framework and is designed to be
responsive, ensuring a visually appealing and smooth user experience.

Lastly, Lungo prioritizes security by default. It comes with HTTPS and secure server settings out of the box, ensuring a
secure environment, and can be configured to rate limit sensitive API endpoints.
